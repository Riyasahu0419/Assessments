# **CipherSQLStudio Assignment**

## **Overview**

Build **CipherSQLStudio** \- a browser-based SQL learning platform where students can practice SQL queries against pre-configured assignments with real-time execution and intelligent hints.

---

## **Project Description**

Create a web application that allows users to:

* View SQL assignment questions with pre-loaded sample data  
* Write and execute SQL queries in a browser-based editor  
* Get intelligent hints (not solutions) from an integrated LLM  
* See query results in real-time

**Important:** This is NOT a database creation tool. Assignments and sample data will be pre-inserted by administrators into the database. Your focus is on building the user experience for attempting and solving SQL assignments.

---

## **What You'll Build**

### **Core Features (Required \- 90%)**

#### **1\. Assignment Listing Page**

* Display all available SQL assignments  
* Show assignment difficulty, title, and brief description  
* Allow users to select an assignment to attempt

#### **2\. Assignment Attempt Interface**

* **Question Panel:** Display the selected assignment question and requirements  
* **Sample Data Viewer:** Show the pre-loaded table schemas and sample data relevant to this assignment  
* **SQL Editor:** Code editor for writing SQL queries (Monaco Editor recommended)  
* **Results Panel:** Display query execution results in a formatted table  
* **LLM Hint Integration:** A "Get Hint" button that uses an LLM API to provide guidance (not the full solution)

#### **3\. Query Execution Engine**

* Execute user-submitted SQL queries against PostgreSQL  
* Return results or error messages  
* Implement query validation and sanitization for security

### **Optional Features (10%)**

* Login/Signup system for users  
* Save user's SQL query attempts for each assignment

**Note: Submissions found to be built using AI-generated code will be disqualified. We are not evaluating completeness – we are evaluating understanding. Build what you can, but build it yourself.**

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Frontend Stack**

**Required:** React.js   
**Styling:** Vanilla SCSS with mobile-first responsive design approach

**Why?** We're specifically asking for vanilla SCSS to evaluate your fundamental styling abilities.

### **Required Approach**

* Build mobile-first responsive layouts (320px, 641px, 1024px, 1281px)  
* Use SCSS features: variables, mixins, nesting, and partials  
* Follow BEM or similar CSS naming conventions  
* Ensure touch-friendly UI elements for mobile devices

### **Backend Stack**

| Component | Technology |
| ----- | ----- |
| Runtime | Node.js / Express.js |
| Sandbox Database | PostgreSQL |
| Persistence DB | MongoDB (Atlas preferred) |
| Code Editor | Monaco Editor |

### **LLM Integration**

* Integrate any LLM API (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)  
* **Critical:** The LLM should provide hints, not complete solutions  
* Implement proper prompt engineering to guide the LLM's responses

## **Deliverables**

1. GitHub Repository  
   * Frontend code and backend code  
   * Clear folder structure  
   * .env.example files with required variables  
   * Installation and setup instructions  
2. README.md  
   * Project setup instructions  
   * Environment variables needed  
   * Technology choices explanation  
3. Data-Flow Diagram (Compulsory)  
   * User clicks "Execute Query" → Label every step → Result displays  
   * Include: API calls, database queries, state updates  
   * **Must be drawn by hand** (proves understanding)  
4. Project Demo (Optional)  
   * Show assignment selection  
   * Query execution demo  
   * Hint generation in action  
   * Mobile responsive view

## **Evaluation Criteria**

| Category | Weight | What We're Looking For |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Core functionality & Data-Flow Diagram | 50% | Features work as expected, proper error handling |
| CSS (vanilla css) | 15% | Mobile-first approach, proper use of SCSS features, responsive design |
| Code structure & readability | 10% | Clean, readable, well-structured code with proper separation of concerns |
| UI/UX clarity | 10% | Intuitive interface, good visual hierarchy, smooth user flow |
| LLM Integration | 10% | Effective prompt engineering, hints are helpful but not revealing solutions |
| Demo Video | 5% |  |

### Reference & Helping Guide

A simplified helping guide is provided below with:

* Essential schema design hints  
* Key architectural decisions  
* Sandbox Guide

Note: The guide provides hints and direction, not complete solutions. You must figure out implementation details yourself. This is meant to clarify the project requirements and help you complete it faster.
